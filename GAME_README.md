## Customization

```python
wild_pokemon = [
    (25, 'pikachu'),
    (94, 'gengar'),  # Add new Pokemon
]
```

### Change Encounter Rate
Edit line 253 in `pokemon_game.py`:
```python
if random.random() < 0.05:  # Change 0.05 to desired rate (0.1 = 10%)
```

### Modify Damage Formula
Edit the `calculate_damage` method in `BattleSystem` class

### Change World Size
Edit lines 133-134 in `pokemon_game.py`:
```python
self.world_width = 1920  # Change width
